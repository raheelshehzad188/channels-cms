					    <h3>WORKOUT PLANS</h3>
					    <ul>
					      	<li>Understand that the phrase “If you build it, they will come” is not true in business.</li>
					      	<li> Love your mastermind or service so much that you feel like you are doing people a disservice if you don’t get them to cut you a check to join. Realize that you sell people on things you love daily. Like Dean’s story about Lisa selling him on the Italian restaurant.</li>
					      	<li>Remember that Dean says the true definition of selling is “Getting people emotionally engaged in something that can change their lives.”</li>
					      	<li>Make sure you are not embarrassed to sell and always have enthusiasm for what you’re selling.</li>
					      	<li>Always be authentic in everything you do. People want to know the real you.</li>
					      	<li>Make sure you sell yourself daily on why you are doing everything that you do.</li>
					      	<li>Make sure you live in the minds of your students so you can truly feel their fears and desires.</li>
					      	<li>Make sure your students feel understood, not understand you.</li>
					      	<li>Understand the difference between what people need and what people want.</li>
					      	<li>Eat, sleep and breathe your mission and go out and sell the world on why your event is a must for them.</li>
